This file is the step by step instructions and the crux of how this project is made

Apollo server takes object as an arguement that object expects two properties 
    1. typedefs - short for type defenitions these are basically the discription of our 
    data types and relation they have with other data types, this is the schema of the 
    graphql  
    2. resolver - bunch of resolver functions that determines how we respond 
    to queries for different data on the graph
